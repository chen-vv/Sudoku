Sudoku Recognition And Its Solution Using Image Processing And Constraint Programming And Backtracking

This work allows optical recognition and solution of the sudoku. Image processing techniques enable its detection and extraction of the digits from the sudoku. The extracted digits are then recognized using a convolutional neural network combined with a deep neural network. Constraint programming combined with backtracking enables the faster solution of the sudoku, no matter how hard it is.

## Instructions To Use
To perform recognition and solution of the sudoku, accumulate the images in a directory and then provide the complete path to the directory in this, or you can use live video feed through the webcam using this.
